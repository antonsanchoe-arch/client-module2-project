            <p>
                We are lifelong fans of comic books, inspired by the universes of Marvel, DC Comics and Dark Horse.
                This project was created to gather the most iconic characters, the most powerful story arcs and the most fascinating legacies into a single place.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our goal is to celebrate the artists, writers and creators who built these worlds — and to give fans a space to explore characters, compare universes and design their own stories.
            </p>
            <p>
                From the Avengers Tower to the Batcave, from Hellboy's Bureau for Paranormal Research to the cosmic battles of the Lantern Corps —
                we honor the heroes, villains and mythologies that have shaped comic history.
            </p>
